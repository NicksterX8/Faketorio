rotation stuff
x = x * cos - y * sin
y = x * sin + y * cos

fix tile rendering, try doing the thing with making textures that dont fill the entire thing's edges the right colors or something
might've fixed it differently actually, by adding 0.5 to the coords

Anyways, might do entity highlights and stuff, hotbar fix. k byee

add texture rendering to quad renderer (change name?)

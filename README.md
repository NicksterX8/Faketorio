# Faketorio

A 2D tile based game loosely inspired by factorio, trying to make something cool.

Current technical features, almost everything made from near scratch:
- homemade OpenGL rendering
- an infinitely expanding chunk based tile map
- text rendering with freetype2 and some GUI elements
- A console usable to enter commands that do a variety of things and display messages
- An ECS
- Good code (just kidding)
